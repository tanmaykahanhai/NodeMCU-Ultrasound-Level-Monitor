# Smart Waste Management System - Smart Bin Monitor

This project uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 board and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the level of a container. The sensor emits a high-frequency sound wave and measures the time it takes for the wave to return. This time is then used to calculate the distance to the surface of the liquid. This data is transferred onto a web server, from where we can display it on a web page and an app. We also connected Alexa by creating a developer skill and asking the status of the container.

## Requirements 
* NodeMCU ESP8266 board
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* Jumper wires
* Computer with Arduino IDE installed
* Computer with an Internet Connection
* A Plastic container
